Datset Used: Fashion MNIST
About the Fashion MNIST dataset:
One of the foundational datasets for learning and benchmarking algorithms is the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database, by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher Burges. This dataset is comprised of images
of 70,000 handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The images are 28 × 28 grayscale.Fashion MNIST is designed to be a drop-in replacement for MNIST that has the same number of records, the 
same image dimensions, and the same number of classes —so, instead of images of the digits 0 through 9, Fashion MNIST contains images of 10 different types of clothing.
